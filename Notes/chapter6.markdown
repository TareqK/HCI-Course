# Cognitive Aspects 

- Interacting with technology is cognitive.
- We need to take into account cognitive processes involved 
and the cognitive limitations of users.
- Provides us with knowledge about what users can and cannot do .
- Identifies and explains the nature and causes of problems.
- Supply theories, modeling tools, guidance, and methods
that can lead to the design of better interactive products.

## Cognitive Processes

1. Attention.
2. Perception and recognition.
3. Memory.
4. Learning.
5. Reading, speaking, and listening.
6. Problem solving, planning, reasoning and decision making.

### Attention

Attention is selecting things to concentrate on at a point in time 
from the stimuli around us. This allows ups to focus on information that
is relevant to what we are doing. This includes audio and visual senses.

Focused and divided attention enables us to e selective in terms of the
mass of completing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events



#### Implications for Attention

1. Make information salient(active) when it needs attending to.

2. Information at the interface should  be structured to capture users' attention,
by using perceptual boundaries, color, sound, underlining, spacing, animation, flashing lights, etc. However, 
it is important not to abuse stimuli, because that makes using the product
difficult.

3. Avoid cluttering the interface with too much information. 
As a rule of thumb, only 31% of an interface page should be filled with 
information. Crowding makes it difficult to pay attention to something.

### Perception 

- How information is acquired from the world and transformed to experience.

#### Implications for Perception

- Design representations that are easily perceivable.
- Text should be readable.
- Icons should be recognizable.
- The spacing appropriate.
- The contrast in colors between the background and foreground appropriate.
- The sound reasonably loud.
- The speech(if any) should be clear and distinguishable.
- Tactile feedback should be implemented somehow to enable users to distinguish
between different meanings.

### Memory 

- How knowledge is encoded and retrieved.
- We cant remember everything. Our memory isn't that strong.
- Context is important in affecting our memory.
- We recognize things better than we recall them.

We remember less about objects we photograph than when we observe them 
with the naked eye.

The more we pay attention, the more we process something. The more
we process something, the more likely it is to be remembered.

#### Magical number 7 plus or minus 2

Our immediate memory capacity is very limited. People remember 5-9 
things. It is useful to know this and take it into consideration when
designing a product. 

In fact, a lot of designers will put 7 options/icons/bullets/tabs/etc. This
is not correct practice, and isnt really needed because GUIs work more 
on recognition than recalling. However, it is important to not clutter 
up our menus. 

#### Digital Content Management

This is becoming an issue for many users. The vast number of multimedia that
users consume.  Where and how to save them, and remembering what they were 
called, and where to find them again is an issue. Naming is the most common
means of encoding them. However, it can be difficult to remember, especially when
we have 1000s of them. How might such a process be facilitated taking into 
account people's memory ability.

Recall that(heheheh recall)Memory involves 2 processes : 

1. Recall-directed scanning.
2. Recognition-based scanning

File managers are designed to optimize both memory processes.

#### Memory Aids

Memory aids are things that assist us in recalling/recognizing things. They 
could be techniques, or softwares, or even devices.


#### Design Implications for Memory

1. Don't overload users' memories with complicated procedures for carrying out tasks.
2. Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall.
3. Provide users with various ways of encoding information to help them remember, eg 
categories, colors, flagging, time stamping.

### Learning

People find it hard to learn by following instructions in a manual. They 
want more visual media, or to learn by doing.

### Design Implications for Learning

1. Design ingerfaces that encourage exploration
2. Design interfaces that constrain and guide learners.
3. Dynamically linking concepts and representations can facilitate the learning
of complex material

### Reading, Speaking, and Listening

People differ in what they prefer. Some prefer to read, others like 
speaking, others like listening. They require varying degrees of 
effort to do. 

Some people may have difficulties in one area, for example 
Dyslexics have difficulties understanding difficult words, 
deaf people can't listen, mutes and people who stutters cant 
speak. It is important to understand this and take it into 
consideration.

#### Design Implications

1. Speech based menus and instructions should be short.
2. Emphasize the accent of AI voices. They are harder to understand.
3. Provide opportunities for making text large on a screen.

### Problem Solving, Planning, and Decision Making

All these processes involve **reflective cognition**, that is, we use
all our previous knowledge. They often involve aware processes discussions,
and artifacts(tools).
