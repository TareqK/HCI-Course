# Cognitive Aspects 

- Interacting with technology is cognitive.
- We need to take into account cognitive processes involved 
and the cognitive limitations of users.
- Provides us with knowledge about what users can and cannot do .
- Identifies and explains the nature and causes of problems.
- Supply theories, modeling tools, guidance, and methods
that can lead to the design of better interactive products.

## Cognitive Processes

1. Attention.
2. Perception and recognition.
3. Memory.
4. Learning.
5. Reading, speaking, and listening.
6. Problem solving, planning, reasoning and decision making.

### Attention

Attention is selecting things to concentrate on at a point in time 
from the stimuli around us. This allows ups to focus on information that
is relevant to what we are doing. This includes audio and visual senses.

Focused and divided attention enables us to e selective in terms of the
mass of completing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events



#### Implications for Attention

1. Make information salient(active) when it needs attending to.

2. Information at the interface should  be structured to capture users' attention,
by using perceptual boundaries, color, sound, underlining, spacing, animation, flashing lights, etc. However, 
it is important not to abuse stimuli, because that makes using the product
difficult.

3. Avoid cluttering the interface with too much information. 
As a rule of thumb, only 31% of an interface page should be filled with 
information. Crowding makes it difficult to pay attention to something.

### Perception 

- How information is acquired from the world and transformed to experience.

### Implications for Perception

- Design representations that are easily perceivable.
- Text should be readable.
- Icons should be recognizable.
- The spacing appropriate.
- The contrast in colors between the background and foreground appropriate.
- The sound reasonably loud.
- The speech(if any) should be clear and distinguishable.
- Tactile feedback should be implemented somehow to enable users to distinguish
between different meanings.
