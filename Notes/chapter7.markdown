## Conversational Mechanisms

mutual greetings, such as hi, hello, all right, hello there, etc.

### Being Social 

We used to communicate only face-to-face or over the phone. However,
nowadays, we use **social media** to communicate, such as facebook, 
linked in, etc. These are changing the way we live and interact 
with one another. However, what are the established rules and customs 
still applicable to online and offline?

### Conversational Rules 

- Rule 1 : The current speaker chooses the next speaker by asking 
an opinion, question, or request.

- Rule 2 : Another person decides to start speaking. 

- Rule 3 : the current speaker continues talking.


- Turn taking used to coordinate
conversation.

- Back channeling to signal and continue an following.

- Farewell customs.

- Implicit and Explicit rules, ie, body language, certain phrases etc.

- Breakdowns in Communication : someone says something that is misunderstood --> repeat in emphasis or use tokens like eh?huh?.

But do the same rules apply in social media? Are there more breakdowns? How do we 
repair them for different media?

### Remote Communication

Even though remote communications are not as rich as face to face communication, 
it is still necessary. 

Much research has been done to support conversations at a distance. Many applications
have been developed, such as email, videoconferencing, videophones, messaging, chatrooms,etc. 

But do these methods mimic or move beyond existing ways of conversing?


#### TelePresence

- Technologies designed to allow a person to feel as if they were present
in te other location

- Project body movements, voice, actions, and facial expressions to 
another person, eg, via superimposing images.
