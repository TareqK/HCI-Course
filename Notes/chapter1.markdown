# Introduction to HCI

HCI stands for **H**uman **C**omputer **I**nteraction. HCI is about 
making using a certain computer system easier and more intuitive  and 
natural to a user. 

HCI changes as the field of computer science advances. As new 
interfacing techniques are researched and come into the mainstream, 
different challenges arise when implementing them in applications. 

Throughout this course, we will be studying the three parts of HCI :

- The Human or User.
- The Computer  
- The Interaction between them, and what feelings result when it happens, 
negative or positive, and how easy ant difficult it is.

## General Design Concepts


### Bad Design 

- Requirements VS Usability : Sometimes, a designer might be given a 
set of requirements that are illogical or otherwise plain stupid. 
Products designed with these requirements are usually not functional

- Good ideas, poor execution : Some ideas might be great, but without 
proper execution  they fail

- Redundancy : Designing things that dont need to be designed

- Poor Unitasking : Designing things that are supposed to do one task 
but do it poorly

- Un-Usable Designs : The product was designed for a purpouse, but it 
turned out to be useless or too cumbersome to design.

- Confusing Design : Some designs are not labelled or otherwise give 
indications on how they are supposed to be used, which causes 
confusion to the user.

### Design Problems and Natural Design

There are psychological principles that can be followed to make sure 
designs are understandable and usable. 

Suppose we want to design a door :

- How does it open(slide/push/pull)?

- Which way does it open(left/right/in/out)?

Well it depends. Do we want the door to be safer by having the joints 
in? do we want it to open out to save space? do we want it to be a 
sliding door? What about locking? Is the door a main door or a room 
door or an exit door?

This comes down to what we are dealing with. An Exit door would 
better be a door that opens to the outside, for example. In internal 
room door, using a sliding door may be more suitable to save space.

Whatever we use, the signals on how to use it must be visible. These are 
called **signifires**, which are parts of the design that naturally 
tell us how the product will be used. For example, having a door knob
indicates the the door is not a sliding door. Having a grip indicates 
that the door is a pull door. Having a pad indicates that the 
door is a push door. Having a hollowed out handle indicates that the 
door is a sliding door.

This use of natural signals is called **natural design**.

### Mapping 

Mapping is the mapping between What about what is possible 
to do vs what you want to do.

Lets say we have some shutters. How do we control them? One button to 
do everything? Two or more buttons? What is the **mapping** of the 
object's function(s)?

Mapping technically means the relationship between two things. Say we 
are driving a car, we know that turning the steering left or right 
turns the car left or right. But say we are sailing a ship, turning the 
wheel left turns the ship right, and turning it right turns the ship 
left.

Good mapping takes advantage of physical queues and cultural 
standards. For example, a designer can use **spatial analogy**, where 
the controls actuate the product in the same direction
and the pattern of controls matches the pattern of the actuators.

### Affordance

Affordance is the perceived and actual properties of a thing. That is, 
what the object was designed to do vs what it can actually do. For 
example, a chair is designed for sitting, however, we can also use the 
chair to reach higher places, or place objects on it. 

We say that a chair affords or is for support, and therefore, affords 
sittings.

We can say that affordance is the **relationship between the person and 
the object**.

Returning to the door object above, lets say the door has a panel, then 
the door affords a person to push.

### Conceptual Models

Look at this design. This is the convergent bycicle, a design for a 
bicycle that can be used both ways. Does it work?

![](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lekish/8132059/4478/original.jpg)

We know it doesnt work because if we try to imagne it working, it just 
doesnt. If we want to steer, we cant. and it is very heavy to move. We 
can do a simple simulation  in our mind and see that it wont work.

This conceptual model is based on the affordance of the product 
relative to us.

A conceptual models is formally defined as:

> an explanation, usually highly simplified of how something should 
> work.

A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our 
actions. ie, we can expect how the product will work without being 
told. Without a good model, we are operating blindly. For everyday 
things, this model has to not be complex.

Say we have a washing machine, with all these dials and buttons and 
options and slots. It can be confusing for a first time user to use it. 
All these options are confusing. Say we have another washing machine, 
with one bay and one button. Using this is very intuitive, and anybody 
can use it.

Another Example of a product that can be simple or difficult to use is 
a refrigerator. During summertime, we need the fridge to be colder, and 
in winter, we need it to be less cold. A fridge can have an arbitrary 
scale. It can have 2 controls, one for the fridge and one for the 
freezer. The scales could mean different things. In contrast, using a 
scale based on temperatures is much easier. However, this is more 
costly, so many fridge designs have arbitrary scales. There are many 
factors in design.

Given the correct model, life would be much easier.

Sometimes, the **design model** thought up by the designer may seem 
easy for him or her, but the **system image**(the physical structure, 
including labelling, documentation, and manuals) might not make the 
model clear and consistent. This results in the **user model** generated by 
using the system being different than the designer model, leading to 
misconceptions about usage.

### Feedback

Feedback is sending information back to the user that something has 
been done and what the status of the action is(or was). In a product, 
it could be something as simple as lighting a light or producing a beep
informing the user of what is going on. The lack of feedback makes 
using the product a pain, since we cant tell if something is right or 
wrong.

### Good Design 

A good design has the following :

1. A Good conceptual model.
2. Visible features.

Creating a product that is difficult to use, even if it does performs 
it's tasks, is useless, and the product will not succeed. Things need 
to be easy to use and should be labelled or indicated somehow. A User 
should be able to see themselves use the product and be able to use it 
with little to no instruction.

---


### Constraints 

There are other factors that come to play in designing something, other
than the functionality. Cost, scalability, compatibility, 
manufacturability, size, space,etc.

- The **Manufacturer** wants something to be produced economically.

- The **Store** wants it to be attractive, with a reasonable price.
 
- The **Customer** wants it to be cheap, but of good quality, appearance, and 
  functionality.

- The **Repair Service** cares about maintainability and repairability.

The designer may not always be able to satisfy everyone related to the 
product, since their needs and wants often conflict. However, he may be 
able to satisfy their needs to a reasonable level.

### Complexity

There is a design problem, especially in technology, called the **curve 
of complexity**.

![The curve of complexity](https://yayeps.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/u-shaped-curve2.jpg)

This curve illustrates how designing a product goes. At first, it is 
difficult, then it gets easier, since we are used to the concepts of 
the product we are making. Then, as more and more features are being 
added, it gets harder again. This goes on and on, so as long as we are
designing and implementing a product.

## Donald Norman's Principles of Design


[Donald Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman), the godfather 
of HCI(and user centred design), had 7 basic design principles :

1. Forming a **goal** : what do i want the product to do?
2. Forming an **intention** : preparing to take action.
3. Specifying an **action** : planning what you are going to do. 
4. Executing the **action** : executing our plan.
5. **Perceiving** the state of the system : studying and monitoring 
   what we made.
6. **Interpreting** the state of the system : Interpreting where we 
   went right and wrong with our design.
7. **Evaluating** the outcome : study what we have collected and 
 if it satisfies our goal.
 

These are divide to 2 gulfs :

1. The gulf of execution : which are steps 1-4 above.
2. The gulf of evaluation : which are steps 5-7 above.  

These gulfs are used to bridge the gap between what we want to do and 
what we have done.

summarising these we must ask ourselves :

1. What do I want to accomplish? <-- Goal
2. What are my alternatives? <-- Execution
3. What can I do now? <-- Execution
4. How do I do it? <-- Execution
5. What happened? <-- Evaluation
6. What does it mean? <-- Evaluation
7. Is it fine? Have I accomplished my goals? <-- Evaluation
