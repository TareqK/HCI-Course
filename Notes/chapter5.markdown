# Design, Prototyping, and Construction

A prototype is a small scale model of the product. In Interaction design,
it could be 

- A series of screen sketches.

- A story board.

- A slide show.

- A video simulation.

- a lump of wood?

- A cardboard model.

- A piece of software with limited functionality written in the target
language or another language.

We use prototypes for :

- Evaluation and feedback that are central to Interaction Design.

- Stakeholders can see, hold, interact with a prototype more easily
than a document or a drawing.

- Team members can communicate effectively.

- You can test out ideas for yourself.

- It encourages reflection, a very important aspect of design.

- Prototypes answer questions, and support designers in choosing between 
alternatives.

Prototypes have :

- Appearance : Material, Resolution, Scope.

- Data.

- Functionality.

- Interactivity.

- Spatial structure.

## What to prototype

1. Technical Issues 

2. Work flow, task design.

3. Screen layouts and information display.

4. Difficult, controversial, critical areas.

## Low Fidelity Prototype

- Uses a medium unlike the final medium.

- Quick, cheap, easy to change.


### Storyboards

- Often used with scenarios, bringing more details.

- Series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task 
using the device.

- Used early in design.

- Could be complex drawings or simple symbols.

### Wizard of Oz prototyping

- The user thinks they are interactive with a computer, but a developer is 
responding to output.

- Usually done early in design to understand user expectations.

---

## High Fidelity Prototype

- Use materials that you will use in the final product

- Look s more like the final system

- Develop using by integrating existing hardware and software components

- Danger that users think they have a full system.

---

## Compromises in Prototyping

- All prototypes involve compromises.

- Horizontal compromise : wide range of functions, but no details.

- Vertical compromise : A lot of detail for a few functions.

---

## Construction 

- Taking the prototypes or learning from them and creating a whole.

- Quality must be attended to.

- Product must be engineered : 
  - Evolutionary prototyping.
  - Throw away prototyping.
