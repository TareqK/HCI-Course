# Data Gathering 

No experiment is complete without data. We need the data to determine 
the outcomes of the experiment. There are many issues related to 
data gathering, and many techniques to collect it. 

## Key Issues

1- Setting goals : decide what we are collecting and why we are collecting it,
and how we are going to analyze it.

2- Identifying participants : Decide who to gather data from.

3- Relationship with participants : Clear and professional, with 
informed consent where appropriate.

4- Triangulation : Look at data from more than one perspective, collect
more than one type of data.

5- Pilot studies : Small trial of main study.

## Data Recording Techniques

There are many ways to record data : notes, audio, video, photographs.
Each has its own challenges and advantages, as does every combination of them


### Interviews 

There are 3 kinds of interviews : 

1- Unstructured(open ended): not directed by a script. They are rich
but not replicatable.

2- Structured : interviews that are tightly scripted, often like a 
questionnaire. They are replicatable but not rich.

3- Semi-structured : guided by a script but interesting issues can be 
explored more in-depth. They strike a good balance between richness and 
replicability.

In addition, there are **focus groups**, which are group interview.

#### Interview Questions 

These are 2 kinds :

- Closed questions : questions with predetermined answers, such as yes/no,
multiple choice, etc.

- Open questions : questions without a predetermined format. 

Closed questions are easier to analyze.

It is best practice to avoid long questions, compound sentences, 
jargon, leading questions and assumptions, and unconscious biases. 

Questions must be focused and precise, and be able to extract the true
opinions of the interviewee. 

#### Running an Interview 

1- Introduction : introduce ourselves, the goal of the interview, 
reassure about ethical issues, ask for permission to record, and 
present any consent form.

2- Warm-up : start with easy and non-threatening questions.

3- Main body : present questions in a logical order.

4- Cool-off period : a few easy questions towards the end to diffuse the
tension.

5- Closure : thank interviewee, signal the end, eg, by turning off the 
recording.

Furthermore, you can use props, which are devices for prompting the interviewee.

### Questionnaires

- Questions can be close or open.

- Closed questions are easier to analyze, and can be done by computer.

- Can be administered to large populations.

- Paper, email, and the web used for broadcasting.

- Sampling can be a problem when the size of population is unknown 
as is common online.

- The impact of a question can be influences by question order.

- Do we need different versions of the questionnaire for different populations?

- Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaires.

- Strike a balance between using white space and keeping the questionnaire 
compact.

- Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative, or 
mixed.

#### Question and Response Format

- Yes/No checkboxes.

- Checkboxes that offer many options.

- Rating scales(likert scales(odd number of scale points), semantic scales)

- Open-ended responses.

#### Encouraging a Good Response

- Make sure the purpose of the study is clear

- Promise anonymity.

- Ensure the questionnaire is well designed.

- Offer a short version for those who do not have time to complete
a long questionnaire.

- If mailed, included a stamped addressed envelope.

- Follow up with emails, phone calls, letters.

- Provide an incentive.

- 40% response rate is high, 20% is often acceptable.

#### Online Questionnaires 

1. Pros :

   - Responses are received quickly.
   - No copying and postage costs.
   - Data can be collected to a database for analysis
   - Time require for data analysis is reduces
   - Errors can be corrected easily.

2. Cones 

   - Sampling is problematic if population size is unknown
   - preventing individuals from responding more than once
   - Individuals also have been known to change questions in email
     questionnaires.
