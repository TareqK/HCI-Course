# Chapter 11 : Experimental Design 

## Groups of Studies 

1- True Experiments : Fully random assignment

2- Quasi Experiments : Multiple groups and measures.

3- Non Experiments : Single reading, single group.

### True Experiments

1- Normally based on at least one hypothesis.

2- Have multiple conditions.

3- The dependent variable can be **quantitatively** measured.

4- Uses statistical significance tests.

5- Thrives to remove biases.

6- Is repeatable.

#### Factors to Consider 

- Research hypotheses must be clearly defined and with appropriate scope.

- The dependent variables need to be easy to measure.

- Independent variables and conditions must be easy to control.
