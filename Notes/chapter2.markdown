# Interaction Design

## What to design 
Take into consideration :

1. Who is the user?
2. What are the activities?
3. Where is the interaction taking place?

Design must be optimised to user's needs. The design needs to be tested
if it satisfies the design goals.

## Understanding Users Needs

1. What are they good and bad at?
2. What could be helpful.
3. What provides a quality user experience?
4. Listening to users and get them involved.
5. User tried and tested methods.

Different strokes for different folks.

## User Experience (UX)

User experience is :

> How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world.

That is, the way people feel about it and their enjoyment and satisfaction when using it, 
holding it, seeing it, opening and closing it, etc. Every product that is used by someone
has a user experience. We cannot design a user experience, we can design *for* a user
experience.

User experience is effected by a lot of factors, including brand, features, 
marketing, interface, design features such as color and size, speed, reliability,
build quality etc. All aspects of a product effect that user experience.

## What is Interaction Design?

> Designing **interactive** products to support the way people interact
> in their daily life.

The goal of interaction design is creating useable products that are :

1. easy.
2. effective.
3. Enjoyable.

It is a multidisciplinary field. This means we have to work in multidisciplinary 
teams from different backgrounds with different perspectives. The upside is that
the end design is taken from multiple angles which makes the product better. The
downside is that it is difficult to communicate between disciplines, since they 
all use their own lexicon and jargon, aside from different thinking methods.

### The Process of Interaction Design

1. Establishing requirements <-- See what the user wants.
2. Developing alternatives <-- Begin design and make choices with the user.
3. Prototyping <-- Create a version of the product. 
4. Evaluation <-- Evaluate the product and redesign if needed.

We keep going through this cycle until the prototype satisfies the user requirements, it becomes the final 
product and goes into production.

### Core Characteristics of Interaction Design

1. Users should be involved in every step.
2. Specific usability and UX goals need to be identified, documented, and
agreed upon at the beginning of the project.
3. Iteration needed through  the core activities(processes).

### Why Interactive Design?

1. Help designers understand how to design products that fit in with what people want
2. Appreciate that one size does not fit all. Children want different things than adults, for example.
3. Identify any incorrect assumptions we have about a particular group. For example, not all old people want big fonts.
4. Learn about people's sensitivities and capabilities.

## Cultural Differences in Design

Lets take the example of date formats. Some cultures use DD/MM/YYYY, others 
use MM/DD/YYYY, others may not use the same type of calendar to count 
years and months. We need to account for these in our design, and 
perhaps even modify the design for different regions.

## Accessibility in Design

How usable is the product? How many people can access it? We want as many
people to be able to use the product and benefit from it. This is especially
true when it comes to disabled people, that have mental or physical impairments that 
have an effect on their everyday life.

## Usability Goals

1. Effective to use : effective in terms of number of steps/task, and results.
2. Efficient to use : efficient in terms of time to perform a whole task.
3. Safe to use : Using it would not cause harm(physical or otherwise to the user)
4. Utility : The product has to have all the functionality needed to use.
5. Easy to Learn : The product has to be intuitive and easy to use for the user.
6. Easy to Remember how to use : Features should be distinct and memorable.

There will always be a trade-off. An effective product could be inefficient, 
or an efficient one ineffective. A Safe product could sacrifice utility and
vice-versa.
