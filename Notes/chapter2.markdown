# Interaction Design

## What to design 
Take into consideration :

1. Who is the user?
2. What are the activities?
3. Where is the interaction taking place?

Design must be optimised to user's needs. The design needs to be tested
if it satisfies the design goals.

## Understanding Users Needs

1. What are they good and bad at?
2. What could be helpful.
3. What provides a quality user experience?
4. Listening to users and get them involved.
5. User tried and tested methods.

Different strokes for different folks.

## User Experience (UX)

User experience is :

> How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world.

That is, the way people feel about it and their enjoyment and satisfaction when using it, 
holding it, seeing it, opening and closing it, etc. Every product that is used by someone
has a user experience. We cannot design a user experience, we can design *for* a user
experience.

User experience is effected by a lot of factors, including brand, features, 
marketing, interface, design features such as color and size, speed, reliability,
build quality etc. All aspects of a product effect that user experience.

## What is Interaction Design?

> Designing **interactive** products to support the way people interact
> in their daily life.

The goal of interaction design is creating useable products that are :

1. easy.
2. effective.
3. Enjoyable.

It is a multidisciplinary field. This means we have to work in multidisciplinary 
teams from different backgrounds with different perspectives. The upside is that
the end design is taken from multiple angles which makes the product better. The
downside is that it is difficult to communicate between disciplines, since they 
all use their own lexicon and jargon, aside from different thinking methods.

### The Process of Interaction Design

1. Establishing requirements <-- See what the user wants.
2. Developing alternatives <-- Begin design and make choices with the user.
3. Prototyping <-- Create a version of the product. 
4. Evaluation <-- Evaluate the product and redesign if needed.

We keep going through this cycle until the prototype satisfies the user requirements, it becomes the final 
product and goes into production.

---

### Core Characteristics of Interaction Design

1. Users should be involved in every step.
2. Specific usability and UX goals need to be identified, documented, and
agreed upon at the beginning of the project.
3. Iteration needed through  the core activities(processes). 

---

### Why Interactive Design?

1. Help designers understand how to design products that fit in with what people want
2. Appreciate that one size does not fit all. Children want different things than adults, for example.
3. Identify any incorrect assumptions we have about a particular group. For example, not all old people want big fonts.
4. Learn about people's sensitivities and capabilities.

## Cultural Differences in Design

Lets take the example of date formats. Some cultures use DD/MM/YYYY, others 
use MM/DD/YYYY, others may not use the same type of calendar to count 
years and months. We need to account for these in our design, and 
perhaps even modify the design for different regions. 

---

## Accessibility in Design

How usable is the product? How many people can access it? We want as many
people to be able to use the product and benefit from it. This is especially
true when it comes to disabled people, that have permanent mental or physical impairments that 
have an effect on their everyday life.

---

## Usability Goals

1. Effective to use : effective in terms of number of steps/task, and results.
2. Efficient to use : efficient in terms of time to perform a whole task.
3. Safe to use : Using it would not cause harm(physical or otherwise to the user)
4. Have good utility : The product has to have all the functionality needed to use.
5. Easy to learn : The product has to be intuitive and easy to use for the user.
6. Easy to remember how to use : Features should be distinct and memorable.

There will always be a trade-off. An effective product could be inefficient, 
or an efficient one ineffective. A Safe product could sacrifice utility and
vice-versa. 

---

## User Experience Goals

We have 2 sets of goals :

1. Desirable aspects : satisfying, enjoyable, engaging, pleasurable, 
exciting, entertaining, helpful, fun, stimulating, fulfilling, rewarding,
surprising, etc. These are things we want to have in our products when 
we design them. There are a lot of qualities other than these we want 
in our product.

2. Undesirable Aspects : boring, frustrating, unpleasant, annoying, making
one feel guilty, gimmicky, etc. These are things we do **not** want to have
in our product.


Selecting terms to convey a persons feelings, emotions, etc, can help
designers understand he multifaceted nature of UX.

## Difference Between Usability and User Experience Goals.

Usability goals are the goals related to the characteristics of the
product, while UX goals are related to the perception of the product, 
and is dependant on humans. 

We can have good usability and UX in a product, however, it is usually
a trade off. 

Usability is easier to measure, since it is an **objective** property. UX on 
the other hand, is **subjective**, and differs from user to user, so it 
is more difficult to measure.

Measuring UX is dependant on statistics and collecting data from our 
users and making generalizations from it.

---

## Design Principles 

1. Generalizable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of the design
2. The **do's** and **don'ts** of interaction design.--> Don't repeat work others have done.
3. What to provide and not provide at the interface.--> Look into research into interface design
4. Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience, and common sense. --> There are many studies about this.

### Visibility 

Have signs and signifires. What i want to do should be extremely 
visible. If i have to insert a card to a slot, then the slot has to be 
apparent and labelled. If i have to use a button, then it's action needs
to be marked and labelled, and the button has to be visible to me.

If the product cannot be made visible in its current state, then you need
research other design options

in short :  

> Make relevant parts visible, Make what has to be done obvious.


---

### Feedback

Performing an action with/on the product should give some information 
back the the user in some form or the other. This includes sound, highlighting,
animation, or any combination of these. 

This is doubly important for people with impairments, since we need to be 
able to notify them too. A Deaf man can't hear a beep, a blind man can't
see a flash, etc. We need to take these people into consideration too.

We also need to pay attention to where the product will be used. Something
designed to be used in a factory, for example, will have different
feedback than something designed for home use, in intensity and type.

---

### Constraints

We may need to restrict the possible actions the the user can do. This 
prevents the user from setting incorrect options. Physical objects can be 
designed to constrain things(eg, keys and locks). Software as well can 
be designed to constrain things(through priorities and authentication/authorisation
and flow control).

Sometimes, we have to design a product, but the constraints prevent us from
designing it logically. We have to design around these and make sure they 
are useble.

---

### Consistency

If we want to design a product, then there should be some shared experience
or interface to using it, and it should have similar elements for similar 
tasks(for example, the Ctrl key as the initial of an operation, like
ctrl-c, ctrl-s, ctrl-z). Otherwise, the product becomes confusing. Good, 
consistent design makes the product easier to learn and use.

But what if we cant be consistent? What if the product has to do 
a lot of things, and there isn't a consistent way to express them?

There are 2 types of consistency

1. Internal Consistency : Designing operations to behave the same
**within** the product. This gets increasingly difficult with more 
complex interfaces.

2. External Consistency : Designing operations to behave the same **across**
applications and devices. That is to say, performing a certain operation
using different products is the same. This is usually rare, and 
depends on the designers preference. 

As an example, the keypad on remotes and phones is said to be externally consistent
because it is of the same form. However, a computer keyboard is externally
consistent with a calculator. However, phones and remotes are not externally 
consistent between keyboards and calculators.

---

### Affordances 

Giving clues to users. This refers to an attribute of an object
that shows people how to use it. A button that says "on" invites us
to turn on the product. 

---

### Mapping

Mapping is how the interface relates to the product's functions,
and how they are presented to the user.

As a note, any design that uses labels means that it's mapping 
is not intuitive enough. However, sometimes it is not possible to make a
design completely intuitive given some constraints.

---

Interaction Design is concerned with designing interactive products to support
the way people communicate in their everyday life. It is connected to 
creating a  quality user experience. It requires taking into account a number
of interdependent factors, including context, usage, target groups, culture, 
to make the best possible product.
