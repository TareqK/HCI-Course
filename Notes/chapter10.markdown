# Chapter 10 : Experimental Research

## Types of Behavioral Research

1- Descriptive Investigation : focus on constructing an accurate description of 
what is happening. That is, to say that X is happening. We do this by 
observation, field studies, focus groups, interviews

2- Relational Investigation : Try to tie 2 factors together(correlation).
That is, saying that X is related to Y. We do this by observation, field studies,
and surveys.

3- Experimental Research  : allows the establishment of causal relationship.
That is, saying that X is responsible for Y. We can only do this through controlled
experiments.

## Research Hypotheses

A Hypotheses is defined as :

> A precise problem statement that can be directly tested through an 
> empirical investigation.

Compared to a theory, a hypotheses is a smaller, more focused statement
that can be examined by a single experiment.

### Types of Hypotheses

- Null Hypotheses : typically states that there is NO difference between
experimental treatments. That is, we say there is no relationship between 
factors.

- Alternative Hypotheses : A statement that is *mutually exclusive* with
the null hypotheses.

The goal of an experiment is to find statistical evidence  to disprove
or nullify the null hypothesis in order to support the alternative
hypothesis.

Each hypotheses should specify the **independent variable** and the 
**dependent variable**

- Independent Variable : The factors that the researchers are interested
in studying or the possible cause of the change in the dependent variable.
For example, a participant's behavior. It is usually something we can control.
	
	The IV in HCI is usually factors that relate to technology, the types
	of design, factors that relate to the user, and those that relate
	to context of use.

- Dependent variable : The outcome or effect that researchers are 
interested in.

	The DV in HC is usually things like efficiency, accuracy, subjective
	satisfaction, ease of learning and retention rate, physical or 
	cognitive demand,etc.

## Components of the Experiment

- Treatments, or Conditions : The different techniques, devices, or
procedures we want to compare

- Subjects or Units, the objects to which we apply the experiment treatments. In 
HCI research, these are normally humans with specific characteristics, such
as gender, age, or experience

- Assignment Method : the way in which the subjects are assigned different
treatments.

	Usually, we use Randomization. The treatments are assigned randomly. 
	In a totally randomized experiment, nobody, including investigators,
	s able to predict the condition to which a participant is going 
	to be assigned.

## Significance Tests

When the values of the members of the comparison groups are all known, 
we can directly compare and draw a conclusion. No significance test is 
needed since there is on **uncertainty** involved.

However, when the population is large, and we can only sample a subgroup, 
we need to use **significance tests** to determine how  **confident** we are 
that the results observed from the sample can be **generalized** to the entire
population.


### Type I and Type II Errors

All significance tests are subject to two types of error :

1 - Type I Error : also known as the &alpha; error, or false positive, 
refers to the mistake of rejecting the null hypotheses when ts true 
and should be rejected.

2- Type II Error, also known as &beta; error, or false negative, refers
to the mistake of NOT rejecting the null hypotheses when it is false.

Usually, Type I errors are worse than Type II errors. A Type I error is a
mistake caused by naivety. Type II errors are caused by blindness. A 
Type II error causes a product to not progress, but a Type I error causes
it to regress.

### Controlling the Risks of Errors

In statistics, the probability of making  a Type I error is called
&alpha; or significance level, p value.

The probability of making a Type II error is called &beta; which is 
1 - &alpha;.

&alpha; and &beta; are interrelated. Under the same conditions, decreasing
&alpha; reduces the chance of making type I errors but increases
the chance of type II errors. 

Generally, a very low p value (0.05) is usually used.

## Limitations of Experimental Research

We need well defined, testable hypotheses, with a limited number of 
dependent and independent variables. Experimental research requires
the strict control of factors that may influence the depended variables.

Lab-based experiments my not be a good representation of user's typical 
interaction behavior.
