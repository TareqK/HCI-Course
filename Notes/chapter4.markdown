# Identifying Needs and Establishing Requirements

There are 2 aims for requirements :

1. Understand as much as possible about users, tasks, and context.

2. Produce a stable set of requirements.

This is done by :

1. Data gathering activities.

2. Data analysis activities.

3. Expression and requirements.

All of this is iterative.

Requirements are the stage where failures occurs mos commonly. Getting
requirements right is very important.

## Establishing Requirements

There is a difference between what a user wants and what a user needs.
Requirements need clarification, refinement, completion, and re-scoping.

- Input : Requirements document.

- Output : Stable requirements.

We establish requirements from understanding user needs. They are justified
and related to data. Establishing is different from gathering, since it 
is specific, not general like gathering.

### Different Kinds of Requirements

There are 2 basic kinds of requirements :
 
1. Functional Requirements : What the system should do. Historically, this
is the main focus of requirements activities.

2. Non-Functional Requirements : Operating environment, experience, and 
things surrounding the product and its usage. 

Furthermore, there are more requirements we will learn.

1. Data :
   - What kind of data need to be stored?
   - How will they be stored?
   
2. Environment or context of use : 
   - Where will the product be used?(Physical environment : dust, noise, vibration, light
     heat, humidity, etc.)
   - Who will be using it?(Social Environment : Sharing files, displays, paper, distance,
     work individually, privacy, etc.)
   - Organisation : Hierarchy, support, infrastructure, training, etc.  

3. Users : Who are they ?
   - What their abilities, backgrounds, attitudes towards computers, characteristics etc.
   - System use : novice, expert, casual/infrequent , frequent, etc.
     
     Humans vary in many dimensions. They differ in size, height, strength, and some
     may have disabilities. We have to consider these when designing something.

## Personas 

- Capture a set of user characteristics

- Not real people, but created from real users

- Should not be idealised

- Bring them to life with a name, characteristics, goals, personal background

- Develop a small set of personas with one primary.

A persona represents a set of users we are designing for.

## Data Gathering for Requirements 

###Interviews

Sit down with the intended user, take some supporting props, prototypes, 
etc, to help get the idea cross. These are good for exploring issues, and
are good for connecting with stakeholders. However, they are time consuming 
and may not be feasible to visit everyone.

---

### Focus Groups 

Gather a bunch of users, and do a group discussion/interview. These are 
good for getting an agreement view and highlighting areas of conflict, 
but they can be dominated by certain individuals in the group.

---

### Questionnaires 

Create a questionnaire and have users answer it. Usually, it is used 
in conjunction with other techniques. It can either be quantitative 
or qualitative, and is good for answering specific questions from a large, 
dispersed group of people.

---

### Researching Similar Products

- Good for promoting requirements.

### Direct Observation 

- Gain insights into stakeholders tasks.

- Good for understanding the nature and context of the tasks.

- Requires time and commitment from a member of the design team and 
  can result in a huge amount of data.

- Can give us a false image, because people feel watched.  

---

### Indirect Observation

While not used often, it is good for logging current tasks without 
interfering with the current operation, and since people do not
feel watched, they behave more naturally.

---

### Studying Documentation

- Study procedures and rules from manuals.

- Good source of data about the steps involved in an activity, and 
any regulations on a task.

- Not used in isolation(used with other methods).

- Good for understanding legislation, and getting background information.

- No stakeholder time, which is a limiting factor in other techniques.

### Considerations for Data Gathering

1. Identifying stakeholders : users, managers, developers,
customers, representatives, etc.

2. involving stakeholders : workshops, interview, workplace studies, 
meetings.

3. Focus on **real** users, not managers.

4. Requirements management : version control, ownership.

5. Communication between parties : 
   - Within the development team.
   - With the customer/user.
   - Between users, different parts of an organisation use different 
   terminology

6. Availability of key people.

7. Political problems within the organisation.

8. Dominance of certain stakeholders.

9. Economic and business environment changes.

10. Balancing functional and usability demands.
