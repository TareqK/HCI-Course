# Emotional Interaction

## Emotions and UX

HCI has traditionally been about designing *efficient* and *effective* systems. However,
as of late, It has started focusing on the user's emotions. It has beome
to be more about how to design interactive systems that make people **react**
in certain ways.

Emotional Interaction is concerned with how to design these interfaces.

## Emotional Interaction

What makes us sad? angry? happy? annoyed? We use these and translate
them into different aspects of the UX. Some people can actually get 
attached to certain products. We can actually change human behavior through 
the use of **emotive feedback**.

---

## Expressive Interfaces 

- Provide reassuring feedback.
- However, can be intrusive.
- Color, icons, sounds, and graphical elements and animations are used 
to make the look and feel of an interface appealing.
- This in turn can affect the usability of an interface.

---

## User-Created Expressiveness

Users have created a range of emoticons - text representations of emotions - to
make up for the lack of expressiveness in text.

Also, the use of icons and shorthand in testing and instant messaging has emotional meanings.

---

## Friendly Interfaces

These are interfaces made for technophobes. The company that pioneered this
is Microsoft, with their "at home with bob" software, which used 3d metaphors 
based on familiar places. Agents in the shape of pets were included to talk to the user 
and guide them. However, this was too gimmicky, and trivial, and ended up failing.

## Frustrating Interfaces

These are interfaces that are really really really frustrating to use. This could be 
because the number of steps to do something is high, or is dysfunctional, or slow,
or generally, made by microsoft after 2012.

- When an application doesnt work properly or crashes.

- When the system doesnt do what the user wants it to do.

- When user expectations are not met.

- When the system doesnt provide sufficient knowledge to the user on what to do 

- Ambiguous, stupid, or condemning error messages.

- When the interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky, or patronizing.

- When the system requieres us to perform too many tasks to do something with no pauses or 
do-over unless from the start.

## Gimmicks

- Amusing to the designer, not to the user.
- Avoid these. 

---

## Error Messages

- Must be clear and precise.
- Must be friendly.
- It's bad to use upper case.
- It's bad to use words like FATAL, ERROR, BAD, etc.
- Avoid long error codes. 
- Be careful with audio messages, but use them.
- Provide context.

### Should Computers Apologize?

Computers should be made to apologize. They should emulate human 
etiquette. Would uses be more forgiving? How sincere would they 
think the computer is being? 

It would be nice, but not always.

## Detecting Emotions and emotional technology

Some new products are using technologies and sensors to 
monitor user's emotions, in order to predict user emotions
and aspects of their behavior.

### Facial Coding

- Measuring emotions as they interact with a device.
- Analyze the images captured by a camera of their face.
- Used to measure how engaged the user is.
- 6 core expressions : sadness, happiness, disgust, fear, surprise, anger.
- Use this data to optimize the user experience.

## Persuasive Technologies and Behavioral Change

- Interactive systems that are designed to change people's attitudes and 
behaviors. 

- Many techniques : pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized
messages, recommendations, etc.  

- Also referred to as nudging.

---

## Phishing and Trust

- Tricking users into parting with personal and sensitive details.
- Allows fraudsters to access their bank accounts and draw money 
from them.
- Many vulnerable people fall for it.
- Its social engineering.

---

## Anthropomorphism or Humanization

- Giving human-like qualities to objects.
- Well known in advertising.
- Much utilized in HCI.
- makes people feel more at ease.
- However, it could make people feel more anxious or patronized.

### What Makes Virtual Agents  Believable

- Shapes/Appearance being similar to humans.

- Behavior, how they move, and their facial expressions, up to a limit,
so we do not fall into the **uncanny valley*.

---

## Personalized Messages

Having personalized messages is encouraging to users. Even though they
are just templates that are filled with info, they make the user 
feel better. However, this isn't always the case. Users dislike having
their names associated with errors and faults. 

---

## Implications 

- Different emotional states cause different perception of experience.
- We can get away with more for products intended for casual/fun use rather
than serious tasks.
