## Practical Issues in Interaction design

1. Who is the user?
2. What are 'needs'?
3. Where do alternatives come from?
4. How do we choose among the alternatives?

Interaction design is a process, it is a goal directed problem solving activity
informed by intended use, target domain, material, cost, and visibility.
It is a creative activity, and a decision making activity to balance trade offs.

There are 4 approaches to Interaction design :

1. User-centred Design : Follow what users want in the product.
2. Activity centred Design : See what is best for the activity at hand.
3. Systems Design : Look at a system as a whole.
4. Genius Design : Something nobody has thought of.

## Importance of Involving Users 

1. Managing Expectations
   - Realistic expectations.
   - No surprises, no disappointments.
   - Timely training.

2. Ownership 
   - Make users active stakeholders.
   - More likely to forgive or accept problems.
   - Can make a big difference to the acceptance and success of products.

## Degrees of User Involvement

1. Member of the designing team :
   - Full time : constant input, but loses touch with users.
   - Part time : partial input, but stressful.
   - Short term : inconsistent across project life.s
   - Long term : consistent, but loses touch with other users.

2. Newsletters and other broadcasting devices :
   - Reach more users.
   - Need two way communication.

3. User involvement after product is released(user feedback).

4. Combination of the above.

## The User Centred Approach 

1. Early Focus on Users and Tasks :
   - Who the users will be 
   - Studying cognitive, behavioural and attitudinal characteristics.
   
2. Empirical Measurement :
   - user reactions and performance in various conditions, recorded and analysed.

3. Iterative Design : 
   - When problems are found in user testing, fix them and carry out more tests.
