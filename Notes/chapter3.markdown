# The Process of Interaction Design

## What is involved in Interaction Design

1. User involvement.
2. Degrees of user involvement.
3. User centred approach.
4. Four basic activities.

### Practical Issues in Interaction design

1. Who is the user?
2. What are 'needs'?
3. Where do alternatives come from?
4. How do we choose among the alternatives?

#### Users/Stakeholders

- those who interact with the project.
- those who manage direct users.
- those who receive output from the product.
- those who make the purchasing decision.
- those who use the competitors product.

There are three main categories of users 

1. Primary user : Frequent, hands-on user.
2. Secondary user : Occasional user, or users the product via someone else.
3. Tertiary user : affected by its introduction, or will influence its purchase.

#### Needs 

- Users rarely know what is possible.
- Users cant tell you what they need to help them achieve their goals.
- Instead, we need to look at existing tasks :
  - their context.
  - what information do they require.
  - what collaborates to achieve the task.
  - why is the task achieved the way it is.

#### Generating Alternatives

Humans tend to stick to what they know works. However, considering alternatives
is important to ' break out of the box '. Designers are trained to consider alternatives,
software people usually are not. So how do we generate alternatives?

1. Creativity : Research and synthesis.
2. Inspiration : Look at similar products or look at very different products.

---

#### Choosing Among Alternatives 

- Evaluation with users or with peers, eg prototypes.
- Technical feasibility : some are not possible.
- Quality Thresholds : Usability goals lead to usability criteria set 
early on and checked regularly :
  - Safety.
  - Utility.
  - Effectiveness.
  - Efficiency.
  - Learnability.
  - Momorabilty.

Interaction design is a process, it is a goal directed problem solving activity
informed by intended use, target domain, material, cost, and visibility.
It is a creative activity, and a decision making activity to balance trade offs.

There are 4 approaches to Interaction design :

1. User-centred Design : Follow what users want in the product.
2. Activity centred Design : See what is best for the activity at hand.
3. Systems Design : Look at a system as a whole.
4. Genius Design : Something nobody has thought of.

### Importance of Involving Users 

1. Managing Expectations
   - Realistic expectations.
   - No surprises, no disappointments.
   - Timely training.

2. Ownership 
   - Make users active stakeholders.
   - More likely to forgive or accept problems.
   - Can make a big difference to the acceptance and success of products.

### Degrees of User Involvement

1. Member of the designing team :
   - Full time : constant input, but loses touch with users.
   - Part time : partial input, but stressful.
   - Short term : inconsistent across project life.s
   - Long term : consistent, but loses touch with other users.

2. Newsletters and other broadcasting devices :
   - Reach more users.
   - Need two way communication.

3. User involvement after product is released(user feedback).

4. Combination of the above.

---

## The User Centred Approach 

1. Early Focus on Users and Tasks :
   - Who the users will be.
   - Studying cognitive, behavioural and attitudinal characteristics.
   
2. Empirical Measurement :
   - user reactions and performance in various conditions, recorded and analysed.

3. Iterative Design : 
   - When problems are found in user testing, fix them and carry out more tests.

## Basic Activities in Interaction Design

1. Establishing requirements.
2. Designing alternatives.
3. Prototyping.
4. Evaluating.


The life cycle has 4 main parts, shown here :

It is important to note that the final product is iterated again and again, 
because no product can be perfect.
